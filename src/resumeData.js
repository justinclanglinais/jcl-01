    'aboutme' : `Full-Stack Web Developer skilled in Object-Oriented Programming, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React.js, SQL, Postgres, ActiveRecord, and Redux. Naturally driven to dig in and understand how things work, having taken apart and re-assembled everything mechanical that I came into contact with growing up. In 10 years spent as a Motion Graphics Designer and Video Editor, I utilized Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro, Maya, Cinema4D, and Flash. As a leader in restaurant industry, developed People Management, Hiring & Training, and Labor Management skills. Managed teams of over 40 people across three shops, spearheading hiring, training, and team development. As a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner, I have learned from several high-level instructors and competitors around the world. I have always been curious about coding, and loved the scripting & coding involved in motion graphics and 3D work. This year, I decided to invest in another skillset, and attended Flatiron School's Software Engineering bootcamp!`,
